Title: Updating Dataset and Implementing U-Net Architecture for Image Segmentation

Description:

This repository contains a dataset comprising original images and corresponding mask images split into training, validation, and test sets. The purpose of this update is to document the process of preparing the dataset and making necessary dimensional changes to the images to fit the U-Net architecture.

Changes Made:

Dataset Preparation:
Original images and mask images are provided in separate folders.
Data is split into training, validation, and test sets.
Any preprocessing steps such as resizing or normalization are detailed in the documentation.
Implementation of U-Net Architecture:
The U-Net architecture is chosen for image segmentation tasks due to its effectiveness.
Code implementation of the U-Net architecture is provided, adapted to the dataset dimensions.
Any modifications made to the original U-Net architecture are documented for clarity.
Parameter Tuning:
Hyperparameters such as learning rate, epochs, and batch size are adjusted for optimal performance.
Different approaches to hyperparameter tuning are explored and their effects on model performance are discussed.
Training and Evaluation:
The dataset is used to train the U-Net model with the chosen hyperparameters.
Model performance is evaluated on the validation set to ensure generalization.
Test set evaluation results are documented to assess the model's performance on unseen data.
Model Deployment:
Trained model weights are saved for future use.
Instructions for loading the saved weights and making predictions with new images are provided.
Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Follow the documentation to prepare the dataset and implement the U-Net architecture.
Experiment with different hyperparameters by modifying the provided scripts.
Train the model using the prepared dataset and chosen hyperparameters.
Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.
Save the trained model weights for future use.
